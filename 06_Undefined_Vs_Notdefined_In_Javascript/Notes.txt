#What is loosely Type language ?
=>A loosely typed language, also known as a dynamically typed language, is one in which variables do not have a fixed type. 
=>This means that the type of a variable can change at runtime based on the type of the value assigned to it. 
=>In such languages, you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable

1.Dynamic Typing:
=>Variables can hold values of any type, and the type can change dynamically.

#Example:
let x = 42;    // x is a number
x = "hello";   // now x is a string

#Examples of Loosely Typed Languages
JavaScript
Python
Ruby
PHP
Perl

#Advantages
Flexibility: You can quickly prototype and write code without worrying about strict type rules.
Ease of Use: Itâ€™s easier for beginners to learn and write code.

#Disadvantages
Runtime Errors: Type-related errors might only be caught at runtime, potentially leading to bugs.
Less Predictable: Code can be less predictable and harder to debug due to changing types.

#Example in JavaScript
let a = 10;        // a is a number
a = "hello";       // now a is a string
a = true;          // now a is a boolean

In this example, the variable a changes its type from a number to a string to a boolean, showcasing the dynamic and loosely typed nature of JavaScript.
