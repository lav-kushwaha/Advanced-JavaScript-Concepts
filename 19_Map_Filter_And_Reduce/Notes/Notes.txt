1. map()
The map() method creates a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array. 
It does not change the original array but returns a new one.

#Syntax:
const newArray = array.map(callback);

2. filter()
The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. Like map(), it does not mutate the original array.

#Syntax:
const newArray = array.filter(callback);

3. reduce()
The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.

#Syntax:
const result = array.reduce(callback, initialValue);

Summary
map(): Transforms each element of an array and returns a new array.
filter(): Filters elements of an array based on a condition and returns a new array.
reduce(): Reduces the array to a single value by iteratively combining each element with an accumulator.
