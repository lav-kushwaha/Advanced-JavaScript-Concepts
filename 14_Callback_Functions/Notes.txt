#Callback Functions ?
A callback is a function that you pass to another function so it can be called later, usually after something has finished.
For example, if you want to run some code after loading data from a server, you can use a callback. 
It helps manage tasks that take time, like waiting for a response or handling a button click.
In simple terms, a callback is just a way to tell a program: "When you're done with this, call this other function to continue." 
It makes handling events and delays easier without stopping everything else from running.


#Why Use Callbacks?
Asynchronous Operations: They allow you to handle operations that take time without freezing the rest of your code.
Decoupling Code: Callbacks help separate tasks, which makes your code more modular and easier to read.
Event Handling: Callbacks are fundamental in event-driven programming, where certain actions should happen when particular events occur.
