Q.What is the first javascript engine?
=>First javascript engine is known as "SPIDER MONKEY" used in firefox.

Note : javascript engine is not a machine.

Q. What is javascript engine ?
=>Js is JIT compile language.
=>Javascript engine is not a machine. it just a program written in low level language.
=>i.e, Javascript V8 engine is written in c++

A JavaScript runtime environment is a specialized environment where JavaScript code can be executed. 
It provides everything needed to run JavaScript outside of a web browser, including:

#JavaScript Engine:

This is the core component that parses and executes JavaScript code.
Popular engines include V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js), SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (used in Safari).

APIs:
Runtime environments provide additional functionalities through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). 
These APIs allow JavaScript to interact with the underlying system, such as reading files, making network requests, and accessing hardware features.

Event Loop:
JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it executes code one line at a time. 
The event loop manages asynchronous operations, allowing JavaScript to handle tasks like I/O without blocking the main thread.

#Common JavaScript Runtime Environments:

Web Browsers:
The most common runtime environment, providing APIs for interacting with the DOM, handling user events, and making network requests.

Node.js:
Allows JavaScript to run on the server-side, providing APIs for file system access, network programming, and more.

Deno:
A newer runtime environment focusing on security, built-in TypeScript support, and a simplified module system.

Electron:
Enables the creation of cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

#JavaScript Engine Architecture :
=>Js Engine takes code as the input (What we write in code).
=>This code goes to 3 Major steps :

1.Parsing
2.Compilation
3.Execution

#In Details : 

1.PARSING PHASE :

=>During the parsing phase the code which we write broken down into TOKENS.
=>i.e, Suppose, we write code let a = 10, 
=>so, it broke into token "let" is a token and "a","=","10" is another tokens.

There is also known as SYNTAX-PARSER :
=>The job of SYNTAX-PARSER is basically takes the code and converted into AST (Abstract syntax tree).
=>AST which is generated parse into Compilation phase.

2.COMPILATION PHASE :

=>In Compilation there is something known as JIT(Just In Time) compilation.

Before Understanding JIT compilation understand difference between INTERPRETER and COMPILATION.

Q.Difference between INTERPRETER and COMPILER.

#INTERPRETER
=>INTERPRETER takes your code and start executing line by line in the order.

#COMPILER
=>In COMPILER Before executing any code.
=>It first compile the whole code and it form new code.
=>which is optimized version of new code. which is runs very fast and it has alot of improvement.

Note : INTERPRETER is very fast it does not wait code for compile first and then execute.
but in case of COMPILER it first compile then it is executing.
=>In case of INTERPRETTER we have more speed but in case of COMPILER we have more efficiency.

=>after parsing we got AST and now that AST will goes to the interpreter.
then interpreter converts our high level code into byte code and that code moves to execution steps.
and while doing this all it takes the help of compiler and compiler optimized the code as much as it can on the runtime thats why its also known as JIT compilation.

#JIT(Just In Time)
=>JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation compiles frequently used JavaScript code into machine code at runtime, optimizing performance based on actual usage. 
=>This approach enhances overall speed, despite a slight initial delay, by combining the benefits of interpretation and compilation.

#AOT (Ahed Of Time)
=>AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) Compilation is a method where the source code of a program is compiled into machine code before the program is run, usually during the build process. 
=>This machine code is what the computer's hardware directly executes.

=>In js engine there is AOT in that case the compiler. 
=>it take some peace of code  which is going to execute later and it tries to optimized it as much as it can.
=>its also produce the byte code which is goes to execution phase.

3.EXECUTION PHASE :
=>In the execution phase it not possible without two major component.
1.Memory heap.
2.Call satck
3.Garbage collector.(Mark and sweep algorithm)

#Memory Heap : 
=>Memory heap where all the memory store it is constantly sync with callstack, garbage collector and other thing works together.
=>Memory heap is the space where all the varibales and functions assigned to memory.

#(Garbage collector.)Mark and sweep algorithm :
=>Mark and Sweep Algorithm is a garbage collection technique used to manage memory:

Mark Phase:
Mark all objects reachable from root references (e.g., global variables, active stack).

Sweep Phase:
Sweep through memory, freeing up space occupied by objects that are not marked (i.e., unreachable).

Summary :
=>Whenever we execute any js code it needs container which have everything require to run js code that has run time environment.
=>Browsers has js runtime environment
=>Node js has js runtime environment
and it consitutes of the v8 js engine - it also has access to api, callback queue, event loop etc.
=>Now, Inside js engine there is many phases - the code they went through - 

1.parsing phase 
=>In the parsing phase Tokens are generated and after the tokens the syntax tree parser, parse the whole code and convert the AST.

2.compilation phase
=>AST parser then goes to the interpreter and it produce the byte code and goes into the execution phase.

3.execution phase
=>In execution phase byte code is executed with the help of memory heap and the call stack.
=>and the compiler constantly working upon optimized the code - we have garbage collector (optimized the memory space)

In Short :
When JavaScript code is executed:
It is parsed into tokens and converted into an AST.
The AST is compiled into bytecode by the interpreter and JIT compiler.
The bytecode is executed with the help of the memory heap, call stack, and garbage collector.

Note : 
=>Js runtime environment => js engine (inside)=> there are so many phases - parsing, compilation (interpreter, compiler),execution(Memory heap, callstack)
=>parsing, interpreting, compiling, optimizing, and managing memory.

Q.JavaScript is COMPILER language or INTERPRETTER ?
JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled one. 
Here's what that means:

Interpreted Language:
Execution: JavaScript code is executed line by line by an interpreter, typically within a web browser. 
The browser reads the JavaScript code, interprets it, and executes it immediately without needing a separate compilation step.
Real-Time Execution: Because it's interpreted, JavaScript can be run directly in the browser, making it ideal for dynamic web pages where you might need to respond to user inputs or events instantly.

Compiled Language:
Compilation: In contrast, a compiled language (like C++ or Java) requires the code to be converted (compiled) into machine code by a compiler before it can be executed. 
This compiled code is then run by the computer's hardware.
Execution: After compilation, the executable file can be run directly by the operating system without further processing.

Modern JavaScript Engines:
While JavaScript is traditionally interpreted, modern JavaScript engines (like Google's V8 engine in Chrome) use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. 
JIT compilation compiles JavaScript code to machine code at runtime, combining the benefits of both interpretation (ease of execution) and compilation (speed).

So, while JavaScript is primarily an interpreted language, modern advancements allow it to achieve performance closer to compiled languages in certain contexts.
