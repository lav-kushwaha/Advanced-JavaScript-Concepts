#Higher order function
=>A function which takes another function as an argument or return a function from it is that is known a HOF.

=>A Higher-Order Function (HOF) in JavaScript is a function that either:
1.Takes one or more functions as arguments.
2.Returns a function as its result.
Higher-order functions are a powerful concept in functional programming, allowing you to write more abstract and reusable code.

#Benefits of Higher-Order Functions:
Code Reusability: You can reuse and compose functions more effectively.
Abstraction: HOFs help in abstracting patterns that are repeated across your codebase.
Functional Composition: HOFs allow for powerful functional composition, making your code more declarative and easier to understand.
Higher-Order Functions are a core concept in functional programming and are widely used in JavaScript to write clean, maintainable, and modular code.
