Promise API in JavaScript:

### Promise Basics:
- **Promise**: An object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.
- States: 
  - Pending`: Initial state, operation not complete.
  - Fulfilled`: Operation completed successfully.
  - Rejected`: Operation failed.

### Creating a Promise:

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // async operation
  if (success) resolve(result);  // On success
  else reject(error);  // On failure
});

### Consuming Promises:
- .then()`: Handles fulfillment.
- .catch()`: Handles rejection.
- .finally()`: Runs code after promise settles (either resolved or rejected).

myPromise
  .then(result => console.log(result))  // On success
  .catch(error => console.error(error))  // On failure
  .finally(() => console.log("Done"));  // Always runs

### Promise Methods:
- **`Promise.all([promises])`**: Resolves when all promises resolve, rejects if any fail.
- **`Promise.race([promises])`**: Resolves/rejects as soon as the first promise settles(resolve/reject)
- **`Promise.allSettled([promises])`**: Waits for all promises to settle (resolve or reject).
- **`Promise.any([promises])`**: Resolves as soon as any promise is fulfilled.

//When to use which promise method :
1.Promise.all()
=>suppose, you made 5 api calls, and if you need result of all 5 api calls or to resolved all.
=> and if any one of api fails then it will be reject, so, in this case use promise.all().
=> it is also known as fail first.

2.Promise.allSettled([promises])
=>it will wait for all promises to settle and gives the value of reject and resolved.

3.Promise.race([promsies])
=> As, the name suggest the first promise which is resolve it will give the value of that promise.
=>whatever(resolve/reject) the promise settled first you will get the result of that promise.
=>it will return the result of (first settled promise) weather it is (reject or resolved.)

4.Promise.any([promises])
=>waits for the (first success) or first resolve or first settle promise.
=> success seeking api, seeking for first success api.
=>if all promise will be fails, it wil be rejected and give aggregated error.
=>error : AggregateError: All promises were rejected

Q. Difference btw promise.race() and promise.any() ?
=> Promise.race() will give the first settle promise result weather it will be rejected or resolve.
=> Promise.any() will waits for the (first resolved or success) then it will give the result.
=> if in Promise.any() all the promise will fails then it will give the error.
