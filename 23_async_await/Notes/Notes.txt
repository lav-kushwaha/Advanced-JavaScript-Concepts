 * What is async ?
=>async is a keyword which is we use before the function to create a async function.
=>aync function always return a promise(object)

=>from async function either you will return a promsie or
if u don't return a promise from it, if you return a value, 
then this async function will automatically wrapped the value,
inside a promsie and will return a promise.

//aync await is just a syntactical sugar over promises.
//Behind the scene it is uses promises.
//async await is new way of writing promises.

Note : for Handling_Promises use aync await.

* what is await ?
=> await is a keyword that can be only used inside a async function.
=> await keyword is also used to resolve the promise.
=> await keyword is wait for promise to be resolved then it will move to the next line.


* Example(Imp-example) : Difference between promise vs async await.(v.imp)

//asynchronous operations which is not get data quickly it is take some time.
const p = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
   setTimeout(()=>{
    resolve("Promise resolved value!!")
   },5000);
});


//await is a keyword that can be only used inside a async function.
async function handlePromise(){
    //Js engine will wait(i.e,10sec,20sec,30sec etc) for promise to be resolved then it will move to the next line.
    //otherwise, it will not move, it will wait.
    const val = await p;
    console.log(val);
    console.log("Hello world - await");
}

handlePromise();

//output :
// Promise resolved value!!
// Hello world - await

//promise resolving using .then() method.
function getData(){    
    //Js engine will not wait for promise to be resolved - it will move on to the next line.
    p.then((data)=>console.log(data));
    console.log("Hello world - .then")
}

getData();

//output :
//Hello world - .then
//Promise resolved value!!

*Interview Tips :
//Explain in details if interviewer will ask about aync await.
//Try to explain promises and then tell why we need async await.
//and if possible try to explain how async await works the behind the scenes.
